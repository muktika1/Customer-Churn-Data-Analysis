# Customer-Churn-Data-Analysis
This project uses machine learning models to predict if customers are going to churn or not. We use multiple models like naive bayes, logistic regression, random forest and xgboost to predict the best outcomes out of the four. We focus on the recall score to predict the accuracy.
We first performed data cleaning and preprocessing followed by data analysis and data visualization using matplotlib and seaborn.
From the four, Gaussian Naive Bayes performed the best as baseline models.
We then applied SMOTE techniques to improve the models. After SMOTE, recall score was highest for xgboost model.
We then applied hyperparamter tuning for further improvements.
